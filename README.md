Starfield
=========

Starfield is a story about your space ship, a radio, anda search for something you've lost.

The game and music are by me! I hope you enjoy them both.

Soundtrack is here: http://www.nicktitle.bandcamp.com

You can install it as follows:

0. Make sure you have ```ruby-2.0.0-p247```
1. ```gem install gosu```
2. ```ruby starfield.rb```
3. Use LEFT, RIGHT, and UP arrows to propel the ship through space
4. Use the COMMA and PERIOD keys to tune the radio
5. Find what you've been looking for
6. NOTE: It's not an action game.

(An executable will follow when I get out of alpha)
